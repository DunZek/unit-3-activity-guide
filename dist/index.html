                <h3>1. Consider Figure 9-1 on p208 and read the quote by Archibald MacLeish on p209. How does the photograph suggest that humanity must deal with challenges, not only as individuals, but also as nations, nation-states, and as a global community?</h3>
                <p>When we look at the big picture, the human experience has been very shallow so far. The memories and experiences so far that we’ve made are limited in our tiny little world when in factual, the actual world around us is so big that we
                    can’t even comprehend its size.</p>
                <p>This isn’t to say that other experiences have more value than others, but when given the thought, one must explore the big picture of the nature of the world around us. If we (humanity) do not plan this way, if we do not consider the things
                    outside our worldview, we end up in wars, conflict and many other problems.</p>

                <h3>2. Consider Figure 9-2. Why do you think Maslow organized needs as a hierarchy?</h3>
                <p>The purpose of a hierarchy is to order things in place of importance. In Maslow’s hierarchy, he put the theory forward that explains that humans have to meet certain needs before the higher needs can be satisfied to fulfill an individual.
                    I believe that his theory wasn’t perfect, because there were cases around the world that were exception to the theory.</p>

                        <li>Economic stability</li>

                <div class="grid-2x4">
                    <p>Economic stability</p>
                    <p>Increasing employability could help a nation-state achieve economic stability. The increase of employability encourages the job-money-goods-demand feedback loop, which in turn, keeps a country’s economy growing.</p>
                    <p>Peace & security</p>
                    <p>To achieve peace and security, a country ought to implement effective policies which places the nation-state’s citizens within a secure and healthy environment. Foreign policies such as joining an international defense organization
                        can achieve this.</p>
                    <p>Self-determination</p>
                    <p>To achieve self-determination, a nation-state could revolt against its ruling state for their own sovereignty. In Canada’s case, Canada proved to Britain, that Canadians can stand up for themselves during the world wars. This was a
                        peaceful solution using diplomacy instead of war.</p>
                    <p>Humanitarianism</p>
                    <p>To promote humanitarianism, a nation-state can offer financial support towards a foreign nation or towards their own nation. Currently, Canada is focused on providing help domestically towards Canadians financially and medically.</p>

                <h3>5. What are some consequences for nations when citizens do not feel safe? Why might Canadians feel a fairly high sense of personal security?</h3>
                <p>When the citizens of a nation-state do not feel safe, this will ruin the nation-state. These individuals will start to become cynical, overtly aggressive and protective against each other. This is the collapse of stability, and with it
                    will bring economic, social and political collapse of stability.</p>

                <p>It was explained that failed leadership, lack of international assistance and patriotism caused the downfall of many nation-states. These three factors cause the loss of economic stability, the forfeit to pursue self-determination and
                    humanitarianism, and peace and security. This is because these three factors cause the nation-state to destabilize and lack the correct regulation that makes the gears within the nation-state machine functioning. Usually, this is the
                    cause of corrupt politics, where the motives of these governments are lopsided for their own selfish wants.</p>

                <h3>7. How might a policy of complete isolationism benefit a country or nation? How might it hurt it?</h3>
                <p>The benefits of isolationism are usually short-term. The point of it is to reduce the amount of damage your own nation-state will receive from external sources by limiting your nation-state’s international involvement. However, at the
                    same time when you close the gates to your country, you also remove the benefits that come with being internationally active. This is how complete isolationism can hurt a nation-state, and usually it is a long-term problem. </p>

                <h3>8. Read p220-221. Is isolationism a good response to world issues? Explain your answer.</h3>
                <p>Yes it is, depending on the extent and duration. Isolationism is beneficial when the benefits outweigh the costs, either short-term or long-term. Isolationism becomes detrimental when it is used improperly, for example when a nation-state
                    stops being isolationist after a short duration, when the benefits are within a long-term duration.</p>

                <p class="no-my">Pros: </p>

                <ul class="ul-answer">
                    <li>Unemployment, therefore loss of economic stability.</li>
                    <li>Loss of sovereignty</li>
                    <li>Loss of law enforcement.</li>
                    <li>Loss of Canadian presence and force externally.</li>
                    <li>Loss of security, and thus peace.</li>
                    <li>Inability to maintain Canadian peacekeeping missions, therefore Canada is not able to keep up its humanitarianism.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In conclusion, this is a very horrible idea.</p>

                <h3>10. What issue did Canada and the USA enter into a bilateral agreement for in 1991? Why is bilateral co-operation important when it comes to environmental issues?</h3>
                <p>They entered this agreement because both nation-states did not want to ruin themselves because of their problems, which affect either both of them. In 1991, the issue was environmental.</p>
                <p>It is important for the agreement to be bilateral because if it were not, then the policies wouldn’t be regulated to be effective at dealing with the issue. When it comes to environmental issues for example, one country’s policies might’ve
                    become too strict while another’s is too lax.</p>

                <p>The European Union is an example of a supranational organization. The positives of joining one are the benefits that come along with membership (protection, free trade, support, etc). The negatives are that the members have to relinquish
                    some of their sovereignty</p>

                <p>Foreign policies, or any kind of government policy for that matter, are influenced by the press within a democratic nation-state. Within authoritarian governments, no influence is exerted from the public, instead the government commands
                    how its policies are structured.</p>

                <h3>17. List 3 ways nation-states promote internationalism through foreign policy. Give an example for each </h3>
                <p>Promoting Peace: By encouraging world peace, supportive initiatives from governments are able to promote internationalism. For example, the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in order to force dictator Saddam Hussein to
                    cooperate with the UN.</p>
                <p>Peacekeeping and Internationalism: This is the most obvious. When a nation-state joins an international organization, internationalism is promoted. Canada’s involvement with the United Nations is an example, so are the member states that
                    joined the European Union.</p>
                <p>International Law and Agreements: This is also obvious. When nation-state agree on establishing particular law and policies, internationalism is promoted. For example, NAFTA between the US, Canada and Mexico is an example of how internationalism
                    was promoted because of the free flow of products between each nation.</p>

                <p>Judging from what I’ve read from the book, I need more information. However, I can say that economic sanctions are hard to be implemented effectively. Those that take the brunt of the sanctions are the nation-state’s citizens. There was
                    a theory that the purpose of the UN’s sanctions in Iraq was to make the people revolt against the leader. If the circumstances are not easily controlled, then these sanctions could become ineffective simply because the nation-state
                    hadn’t been majorly affected by it, as it would’ve been able to engage economically with other nation-states.</p>

                    <p>Eric Kierans</p>
                    <p>He sees that nation-states become the cogs of the machine, that is, the international group. He warns that internationalism will result in a country’s specialization, and hence the apparent loss of freedom for a nation-state to exert its resource and manpower for something else, something enjoyable for them perhaps. He does not really see a positive future with these regards.</p>
                    <p>Andrew Herod</p>
                    <p>He argues that internationalism will in the end, result in people becoming more and more focused on being local than rather working with each other, as a result of privacy being reduced from the interconnectedness of the globe. He does not see that globalization will end up connecting Earth’s populations, it will instead divide them further as nationalism will rise from the threat of assimilation from the fact that the world is interconnected.</p>
                    <p>J. Michael Adams and Angelo Carfagna</p>
                    <p>They both see an international world with a bright future. They suggest, that people ought to focus on our commonalities rather than our differences from each other. This is because, they believe that it will bring goodness into the world, the same way that people came together despite how different they are in order to abolish global issues such as hunger, slavery and other forms of injustice, for they have decided to work towards those missions together with themselves.</p>

                <p>Water should not be treated as oil. Why? Because a lack of water will kill populations, wherein a lack of oil may not necessarily do so.  The point is, that water is a human need, but oil is not. If one were to monopolize water, then we would live in a democratic world that is no different from an authoritarian one. Water, and thus human lives, should not be controlled, it must be free.</p>

                <p>“A debt that is incurred by a despotic power, not to meet the needs of the people of the country but to strengthen the despotic regime.”</p>
                <p>I believe that this should be debated for every circumstance. There is no clear answer to this. Should odious debt incur, then the international community must help the fallen nation-state. The point is to not create another Nazi-germany. This time, the world must not isolate itself and the nations of Earth have to support each other. Otherwise, the nation-state should still be regulated. I agree with both. Mismanage runs rampant across corrupt governments, but this is my argument for the intervention of international communities. </p>

                <p>First and foremost, every problem must be first solved locally. The point of internationalism is to provide extra support and aid if necessary. If the problem can’t be solved using local services and resources, then the international community has to step in to provide aid. When the international community is not needed, then they should not intervene because it is unnecessary. Internationalism is not the only way to address contemporary global issues, it should not replace local services that can deal with the problem if needed. </p>
